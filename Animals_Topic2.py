st.write("Animals can be classified according to their eating habits into three primary categories: herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. These categorizations aid in grasping their functions in ecosystems and the ways they acquire energy. ")

st.write("Herbivores")
st.write("Herbivores are creatures that mainly eat plant-derived substances. Their diets are made up of leaves, stems, fruits, and various other plant matter. Instances of herbivores consist of deer, koalas, and caterpillars. These creatures have developed digestive systems that can process significant quantities of plant matter. Herbivores can be divided into frugivores (those that eat fruit), granivores (seed consumers), nectivores (nectar consumers), and folivores (leaf consumers).  ")

st.write("Carnivores")
st.write("Carnivorous animals are those that consume other animals. The term carnivore comes from Latin and directly translates to ‚Äúmeat eater.‚Äù Wild felines like lions and tigers exemplify vertebrate carnivores, just as snakes and sharks do, whereas invertebrate carnivores comprise sea stars, spiders, and ladybugs. Obligate carnivores are animals that depend exclusively on meat for their nutrient needs; examples include members of the feline family, like lions and cheetahs. Facultative carnivores are animals that consume both animal-based and non-animal-based foods. It is important to recognize that there isn't a distinct boundary separating facultative carnivores from omnivores; dogs are typically classified as facultative carnivores. ")

st.write("Omnivores")
st.write("Omnivores are creatures that consume food from both plant and animal sources. In Latin, omnivore translates to consuming all types of food. Humans, bears, and chickens serve as examples of vertebrate omnivores, while invertebrate omnivores consist of cockroaches and crayfish. ")

st.write("Grasping these dietary classifications is crucial for examining animal behavior, ecology, and evolution. Every group has a unique role in the food chain, aiding in the balance and sustainability of ecosystems. ")
