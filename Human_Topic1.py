As young children, it helps us grow tall, and ensures that all our organs are working properly. Food provides nutrients and energy that is necessary for the body to grow and function properly. Without food, we wouldn‚Äôt sustain a long period of time. The energy in food is measured in the unit of calories.")

There are both mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion can include your teeth splitting food into smaller pieces, and mechanical digestion can be stomach acid chemically breaking down food into small pieces so they can be successfully absorbed by the small intestine.")
st.write("During digestion, large food molecules are broken into smaller molecules, and these molecules eventually make it inside cells. In there, chemical reactions rearrange the molecules‚Äô atoms, which makes them form new molecules. Smaller units of food are transported into the blood stream so they can be used by the body.")
